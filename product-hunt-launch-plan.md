### Maker Comment
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

As developers, we were frustrated with expensive agile tools like Jira ($7-14/user/month) that don't integrate well with GitHub. We built Agile GitHub Suite to solve this:

🎯 **What makes it special:**
- **GitHub-Complete**: Issues, Actions, Pages - everything runs on GitHub
- **$0 Operating Cost**: No servers, no databases, just static files
- **Auto-Updates**: NPM package with intelligent update system
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern glassmorphism design with full mobile support
- **Setup in 5 minutes**: Interactive wizard guides you through everything

🚀 **Perfect for:**
- Startups wanting professional agile management without the cost
- Open source projects needing transparent project tracking
- Development teams already using GitHub ecosystem

We've spent months perfecting the developer experience. One `npm install` and you get enterprise-grade agile management that scales from 2-person teams to large organizations.

Try it and let us know what you think! We're passionate about making agile management accessible to everyone. 🌟

## 📱 Social Media Campaign

### Pre-Launch (5日前)
#### Twitter Thread
🧵 1/7 We're launching on Product Hunt next week! 

Building in public: How we created a $0-cost alternative to Jira using only GitHub 🚀

Here's what we learned building Agile GitHub Suite... 

🧵 2/7 **The Problem**: Jira costs $84-168/year per developer. For a 10-person team, that's $1,680/year just for project management. 

Meanwhile, you're already using GitHub for everything else. Why not project management too?

🧵 3/7 **The Solution**: We built everything using GitHub's native features:
- Issues → User Stories & Tasks
- Actions → Automated metrics collection  
- Pages → Beautiful dashboards
- API → Real-time data sync

🧵 4/7 **The Results**:
✅ Zero operating costs (no servers!)
✅ Setup in 5 minutes with NPM
✅ Auto-updates preserve your customizations
✅ Works on mobile + desktop
✅ Open source & highly customizable

🧵 5/7 **Tech Stack Decision**: We chose vanilla JS over React/Vue for a reason:

⚡ Faster load times
🔧 No build complexity  
📱 Works everywhere
🎯 10-year longevity
🤝 Easy contributions

Web standards FTW! 

🧵 6/7 **What's Next**: 
- Product Hunt launch Aug 18
- GitHub Marketplace app
- Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC)
- Global expansion (EN, ZH, DE)

#### LinkedIn Post
🚀 **Announcing Agile GitHub Suite - The GitHub-Native Alternative to Jira**

After months of development, we're excited to share our solution to expensive agile project management tools.

**The Problem We Solved:**
Traditional tools like Jira cost $7-14/user/month and create workflow disruption by pulling developers out of GitHub.

**Our Approach:**
- Built entirely on GitHub's ecosystem (Issues, Actions, Pages, API)
- Zero server costs through static site generation
- NPM-based auto-updates with configuration preservation
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Complete setup in under 5 minutes

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Cost Savings**: Save $1,000-3,000 annually per team
2. **Developer Experience**: No context switching from GitHub
3. **Accessibility**: Makes professional agile management available to all teams
4. **Sustainability**: Open source with transparent development

**Technical Innovation:**
- Vanilla JavaScript for 10-year longevity
- Chart.js for professional data visualization  
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Comprehensive automation with GitHub Actions

We're launching on Product Hunt next week. Would love your thoughts and support!
